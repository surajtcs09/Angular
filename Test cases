1. Angular code can be tested using Jasmine and Karma. 
2. Configuration in test.ts file decides about the component which needs to be tested.
const context = require.context('./', true, /\.spec\.ts$/);
./ means it will run all the test cases in the project. 
./<particular-folder-name-inside-app>  -- It will run all the test case inside that folder. 

It becomes easy to run the test cases when project is very big and there are various test cases.
Making the changes in the test cases and seeing the effect becomes easy. It takes less time to run the testcases 

3. Key to run the test cases: 
ng test 

package.json contains all the commands under script. 
"test": "ng test"   --> It means that npm run test would work for ng test 

Instead of "test" we could write any custom words. 

4. Test cases ouput is not in organized manner. 
For that we can use "karma-mocha-reporter"

    To run it, follow following commands: 

    Step1: >  npm install karma-mocha-reporter --save-dev
    This will install karma-mocha-reporter

    Step2: Make change in karma.conf.js file
    Under plugins: 
    Add  require('karma-mocha-reporter')
    plugins: [
          require('karma-jasmine'),
          require('karma-chrome-launcher'),
          require('karma-jasmine-html-reporter'),
          require('karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter'),
          require('karma-mocha-reporter'),
          require('@angular-devkit/build-angular/plugins/karma')
          //require('karma-mocha-reporter')
        ]
    Step3: 
    And under reporters, add: 'mocha'
     reporters: ['mocha','progress', 'kjhtml']
